Compiling on Linux:
===================

To compile this program, run:

$ make


Once you have compiled it, you can run it as:

$ ./earlyWord



For Windows Users:
==================

Open cmd.exe and run either "earlyWord32.exe" or "earlyWord64.exe"
as appropriate.

While it may be possible to compile it on Windows, this is not
currently implemented.
